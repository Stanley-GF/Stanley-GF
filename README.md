# End of 13yo dev, Stanley-GF, still #1 fan of gravity falls ðŸ˜„

Hi, I don't feel any interest anymore when I create malware. I no longer feel any interest in creating projects for it to be stolen by pitiful skids.

I would like to apologize to all the people who had problems with PirateStealer or with me personally.

All good adventures come to an end.

Thank you for everything

- Stanley
