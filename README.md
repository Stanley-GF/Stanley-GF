Hi, I'm Stanley,
If you joined this server it means that you know me. 

I've been doing "anti-discord" tool/malware/etc for ~2 years, and today I've decided to stop all illegal activities.
I also leave Discord on the name "Stanley", and leave all tech related activites under the "Stanley" name. 

Thank you to all guys that supported me on the projects/tools I made.

*btw i always wanted to live in usa just saying that cuz yeah oh and about all the idiots that r spamming me on twitter saying "Pirate suck" etc, y'all stupids fr.*

Ah and one last thing, I've deleted the PirateStealer github repos. Iâ€™m sorry for doing the things that I did, such as making PirateStealer and any malware. I apologize, although words may not be enough to describe it

I'm on Discord since 2016, and now, it's a goodbye
